# Wallet Test
- The application includes two lists on the same screen
- The first list is a list of wallets the user has
- The second list is a list of transactions the user has performed, paginated
- Tapping on an item on second list, leads user to a details screen (History Details Screen)
- The application supports handling two types of errors (429 with custom error message and 500)
- The application supports delay for each request
